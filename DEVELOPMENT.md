This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks, but be sure to checkout the latest version of the [Create React Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Developing

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to run a development server

## Deploying

Update the version number in `package.json`, then run

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build the app into the `build` folder, and then update the `gh-pages` branch from that.
